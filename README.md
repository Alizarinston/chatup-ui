# ChatUP-UI

Provides user interface for [ChatUP](https://github.com/AverHLV/chatup) application. 

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Development

```
npm run start
```

React uses Node.js on development to open the app on http://localhost:3000, thus the start script enables you to start the server.

This command will not only start the server, but it will also react and display the latest version each time a change occurs. In addition, it will show lint errors on the terminal (console) when it fails to start the server in the form of meaningful error messages.

### Production

```
npm run build
npm start
```
And then point your browser to `localhost:3000`
